# Worduel

## Summary

Worduel is a web game that works just like [Wordle](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html) except you play head-to-head against a friend. Each player comes up with words for their opponent to guess, Wordle-style. Scores are tallied over the course of multiple rounds.
